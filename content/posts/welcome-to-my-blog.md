# Welcome to My Blog!

I'm excited to launch this new blog built with **Next.js** and **Markdown**. This platform combines the simplicity of writing in Markdown with the power of modern web technologies.

## Features

This blog comes with many powerful features:

### Writing Experience
- Write posts in Markdown format
- Edit directly in your code editor or use the built-in admin panel
- Live preview while editing
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks

### Organization
- **Categories** for grouping related content
- **Tags** for more granular organization
- **Draft mode** to work on posts before publishing
- Search functionality to find content quickly

### Code Highlighting

The blog supports syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

```python
# Python example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more content covering:
- Web development tutorials
- Best practices and tips
